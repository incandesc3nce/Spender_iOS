# Spender_iOS
### Expense tracker made via Swift and UIKit.

**Architectural pattern - MVC.**

This is a MVP expense tracker product, it can be further improved ~~(persisting data, logs, currencies etc)~~, but all of the necessary functionality is implemented imo. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Once launched, user is presented with a text field to enter monthly budget in double type.

Keyboard is presented as a number pad. If user presents unviable input (letters or negative double), he gets an alert to input another budget.

Once user provides required input, user can now create their own expenses/incomes - cause, money spent/gained and date of the instance.

For this readme file, I provided 2 expenses and 1 income to see how balance changes and how all of expenses/incomes instances are created in UI.
